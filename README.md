# Bengali Poem Dataset
Stylometric research on Bengali Poems is still in its early stage of development. We have prepared a novel stylometric dataset, which has 6,070 poems of 137 poets stored in the textual format. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stylometric dataset for Bengali poems. We are open to collaborating with you. Please feel free to open pull requests.
